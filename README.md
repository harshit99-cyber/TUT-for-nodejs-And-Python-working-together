# TUT-for-nodejs-And-Python-working-together
you can run one of the powerful language for machine learning python in node js which is a powerful tool for server side

this tutorial is very easy to follow but if you have any issues you may contact me directly on whatsapp 7014834863

module **python-shell** can help you run python in nodejs
it kind of creates a termial instance of python for running python in node

**the basic gateway or route between node and python is ste command of python**
assume nodejs as marker and python as board
**send data node to python**
when you run example node program it will call a funtion name **send()** 
this function will write the following value to python console(virtual console created by nodejs)

so you have to plant some input statement in python to get that value from node

**reciveing data node**
by using print statements of python you can get data out form python file


this is quite easy to learn
